1. d4 Nf6 2. Nc3 d5 3. Bf4 Bf5 {This move, which maintains developmental symmetry, obviously constitutes one of Black's most popular responses.} 4. e3 {We answer the symmetrical variation in outwardly modest fashion, opening up our light-squared bishop and setting up the future idea of g2-g4. A few years back, 4.f3 was virtually automatic, but this innocuous-looking move has overtaken 4.f3 in popularity and in hype -- for good reason. Against most of Black's setups, our knight heads directly for e5, as it does in almost every other variation.} e6 (4... c6 5. Nf3 e6 (5... Nbd7 6. Bd3 Bxd3 7. cxd3 e6 8. e4 {Transposes to 4...e6 5.Nf3 Nbd7 6.Bd3 Bxd3 7.cxd3 c6 8.e4}) 6. Ne5 Nbd7 {The most popular response by far. Most players do not see the danger awaiting them on the kingside!} (6... h5 7. Bd3 Bxd3 8. cxd3 Nbd7 9. Nf3 {[%csl Rh5]} Be7 10. e4 Qb6 11. Qe2 $14 {The pawn on h5 is a huge weakness which essentially precludes kingside castling. We can push e4-e5 at our leisure.}) (6... h6 7. g4 {This is still very strong, even though we are no longer trying to trap the bishop. Instead, we are storming the kingside with our pawns. Black has a very hard time stopping g4-g5, which has the potential to be devastating.} Bh7 8. h4 Nbd7 {This leads directly to a scintillating tactical confrontation.} (8... Nfd7 9. Bd3 {It is important to combine space-grabbing pawn moves on the kingside with simple developing moves. Once the knight leaves f6, g4-g5 no longer comes with tempo, so we hold off on that move for now.} Nxe5 10. Bxe5 Bxd3 11. Qxd3 Nd7 12. Bg3 {Do not be fooled by the symmetrical appearance of a position like this. White has a massive kingside space advantage, as well as better-placed pieces. It is not easy for Black to find a suitable home for their bishop, and must constantly reckon with a well-timed g4-g5.} Bb4 (12... Be7 13. O-O-O Qa5 (13... b5 14. g5 h5 15. g6 $16) 14. Kb1 O-O-O 15. e4 Nb6 (15... dxe4 16. Nxe4) 16. exd5 cxd5 17. b3 Bb4 18. Ne2 $16) 13. a3 Qa5 (13... Bxc3+ 14. Qxc3 Nf6 (14... Qe7 15. O-O-O $14) 15. f3) 14. Kd2 Bxc3+ (14...

Kxc3 Nf6 17. f3 $14 {White can continue by expanding on both sides of the board: a4-a5 comes to mind, and a well-timed g4-g5 will open up the h-file and likely lead to immediate infiltration.}) (8... Ne4 9. Nxe4 Bxe4 10. f3 Bh7 11. Bd3 Bxd3 12. Qxd3 {Here, we recapture on d3 with the queen to preserve the integrity of the queenside. On the next move, we will castle queenside and our minor pieces will dominate in the center and on the kingside. White has a small, but very stable, advantage.} Nd7 13. O-O-O Nxe5 14. Bxe5 Qa5 15.

Nxe4 dxe4 12. g6 fxg6 13. Qg4 $18) 11. Rxh8 Bxd1 12. Kxd1 $3 {An incredibly deep recapture. The idea is to move the king away from the checking zone of the d7 knight: after ...Nxe5, ...Nf3 no longer comes with a check!} Nxe5 13. gxf6 gxf6 14. dxe5 {White has a kingdom and a horse for the queen! Black's attempt to open up the center leads absolutely nowhere.} d4 15. Ne4 dxe3+ 16. Ke2 exf2 17. Bh6 $18) (6... Bd6 7. g4 $1 Bxe5 (7... Bg6 8. h4 h6 9. Nxg6 fxg6 10. Bd3 Bxf4 11.

Qxd8+ Kxd8 13. fxe4 $14 {Black is entirely paralyzed, and White will have complete dominance over the d-file after the long castle. We can also stick a rook on d6 at our convenience.}) 7. g4 Nxe5 (7... Bg6 8. h4 h6 (8... Qb6 9. Rb1 Nxe5 10. dxe5 Nxg4 11. Qxg4 Bxc2 12. Qe2 Bxb1 13. Nxb1 Bb4+ 14. Kd1 $14) 9. Nxg6 fxg6 10.

Nbd7 $4 {As usual, the premature development of the b8-knight loses material!} 5. Nb5 {[%csl Ra7,Rc7][%cal Rb5a7,Rb5c7]} Rc8 6. Nxa7 Ra8 7. Nb5 Rc8 8. Bd3 $16) 5. Nf3 {At this point, Black is at a major crossroads. There are countless ways for Black to develop, starting with the natural developing moves (5...Nbd7, 5...Bd6, and 5...Bb4) and ending with more extravagant moves such as 5...Ne4. We must consider all of them, since White's responses are a bit different in each case.} Bd6 {This is the most common move on Lichess, with 127,000 or so games at the time of analysis (and, hopefully, many more after the course enters the chess bloodstream :).} (5... Nbd7 {Believe it or not, this natural developing move is eighth (yes, eighth!) by popularity in the Lichess database. However, at the titled player level, it is the most common move, so it must be treated like a main line. Black immediately contests the e5-square, delaying the development of his dark-squared bishop until we have put our cards on the table. Now, 6.Ne5 makes no sense due to 6...Nxe5; the exchange does not yield any benefit. Instead, we aim for plan B, quickly completing our development and initiating queenside pressure.} 6. Bd3 Bxd3 (6... Bg6 7. Bxg6 {Generally, it is not a great idea to capture on g6 since it hands Black the h-file, but we follow it up with a concrete and powerful idea.} hxg6 8. Nb5 {The point! It transpires that Black has great difficulty defending the pawn, since ...Bd6 drops a pawn (though White must still respond accurately - see analysis below) and ...Rc8 drops the a7 pawn (after which the knight returns to b5). Indeed, there is only one way to defend c7, and it is not all that easy to find.} Bb4+ {Rushing the bishop to a5. This idea constitutes one of Black's main responses to 3...e6 4.Nb5. In this version, the placement of Black's knight on d7 granmts us the ability to engineer nasty queenside pressure.} (8... Bd6 $2 {This is actually the most common move, since ...Bb4-a5 is not the easiest maneuver to find for someone who is not experienced in this type of position.} 9. Bxd6 cxd6 10. Nxd6+ Ke7 {Now, it is crucial to refrain from 11.Nb5, which enables Black to seize the initiative with a check on a5 followed by ...Ne4. Instead, we help ourselves to another pawn!} 11. Nxb7 Qb6 12. Nc5 Nxc5 13. dxc5 Qxc5 (13... Qxb2 $2 14. O-O {We can follow up with Rb1-b7 or Qd4. Black is in serious trouble.}) 14. c3 Rab8 15. Rb1 $14 {Black has no compensation for the pawn. We will follow up by castling kingside; there is nothing to fear along the h-file, since the h2-pawn is very safely protected by the knight. Black will have a hard time finding shelter for their king. As a case in point, 15...Qc4 is met with the powerful 16.Ne5, angling for c6.}) 9. c3 Ba5 10. Qa4 {Deploying the queen with tempo, and preparing c3-c4. In the position after 3...e6 4.Nb5 Bb4+ 5.c3 Ba5, this move is ineffective due to ...Nc6, defending the bishop and cutting off the line of fire toward Black's king. Here, Black has no choice but to meekly withdraw the bishop, since 10...c6 runs into 11.Nd6+ followed by Nxb7.} Bb6 11. c4 a6 12. Nc3 c6 13. Qb3 {The queen has done its job on a4, and we now reposition it to the optimal square.} dxc4 (13... O-O $2 14. c5 $18) 14. Qxc4 Bc7 15. Bg5 $14 {[%cal Rh2h4,Re1g1,Re3e4,Ra1d1] White's advantage is indisputable. After buttressing our bishop with h2-h4 and castling short, we will turn our attention toward the center, expanding with e3-e4 and solidifying our center with R(a)d1.}) (6... Ne4 $6 {This is simply bad, as it enables us to ruin Black's pawn structure. Additionally, the bishop on f5 will end up totally out of commission.} 7. Bxe4 dxe4 8. Nd2 Bb4 9. Nb5 {Yet again, the knight sally to b5 is very effective.} Ba5 10. c3 {This is a lot better than 10.c4, which would justify the placement of Black's bishop on a5. Now, the bishop is taken out of the game and we follow up with a furious queenside pawn storm.} O-O 11. b4 Bb6 12. c4 $14 {[%cal Rc4c5,Rb5c3] Black is under massive pressure due to the threat of c5 as well as Nc3, when the e4-pawn, in the immortal words of GM Robert Hess, will not be long for this board. Note that ...Nf6 can be savagely met with Bg5.}) (6... Bb4 7. O-O {This is an improved version of the position we reach after 5...Bb4. The inclusion of the moves ...Nbd7 and 0-0 clearly favors White, since ...Ne4 is no longer a palatable option.} O-O (7... Ne4 8. Nb5 Ba5 (8... c6 $4 9. Nc7+ $18) 9. b4 {Let the queenside pawn storm begin!} Bb6 10. Bxe4 {Eliminating the knight grants our b5-knight a nice retreating square on c3.} Bxe4 11. a4 a6 12. Nc3 Bg6 13. a5 Ba7 14. Qe2 O-O 15. Na4 $14 {We have built up a massive clamp on the queenside, and things will go from bad to worse once we stick the knight on c5.}) (7... Bxc3 8. bxc3 {Obviously, this pawn structure transformation only favors White, since c3-c4 now comes with even greater effect.} O-O 9. c4 c6 10. cxd5 cxd5 11. Qb1 $1 {Hitting Black where it hurts!} b6 12. Rc1 {[%cal Rc2c4] The power of doubled pawns on full display. The first c4 break served to soften up Black's queenside, and the second instantiation of this pawn advance will cause even more problems.} Rc8 13. Ba6 $1 {Transitioning to tactics! It transpires that the rook runs out of squares!} Rc3 (13... Ra8 14. Bb7 $16) 14. Qb2 Rc6 15. Bb7 Rc4 16. Nd2 $18 {The rook has breathed its last breath.}) 8. Bxf5 exf5 9. Ne2 {Standard Sam! We prepare the typical plan of queenside expansion with b3 and c4, and make the bishop on b4 look rather dumb.} Ne4 10. c3 Be7 11. h3 {It is always worth including this move to take the sting out of ...g5, which is now duly met with Bh2.} c6 12. b3 $14 {We are ready to push c4, and we can follow up by smoking the knight out of e4 with Nd2.}) 7. cxd3 {This recapture should be automatic by now! We follow up in traditional fashion by deploying our queen to b3 and building up nasty queenside pressure along the c- and b-files.} Bd6 (7... c5 8. O-O {Keeping the tension. Of course, the impulsive 8.Nb5 would have run into 8...Qa5+, sending the knight right back to c3. Now, it appears that Black can cripple our pawn structure by capturing on d4, since Nxd4 runs into a fork. It turns out that Black is in for quite a surprise!} Be7 {The most sensible option, preparing to castle kingside. Still, by resolving the central tension, we will attain a stable and long-lasting edge.} (8... a6 {This prevents Nb5, but costs Black another tempo. We pile up on the queenside without any further delay.} 9. Rc1 Rc8 10. Qb3 b5 {This appears to call White's previous move into question: why provoke a move that grabs space and builds a rather imposing wall of pawns? In reality, the dutiful student of this course will know that ...b7-b5 is almost always a dreadfully weakening move, leaving behind massive holes on the light squares (particularly c6) and handing White the keys to a ravaging queenside initiative.} (10... Qb6 11. dxc5 Qxb3 12. axb3 {It may appear that Black is out of the woods after recapturing on c5, but his troubles are only beginning. Note that the rook on c8 lacks a defender - this tactical deficiency is about to become very important, regardless of which piece Black decides to recapture with.} Nxc5 (12... Bxc5 13. d4 {Sending the bishop back, and paving the way for a straightforward and devastating tactical blow.} Be7 (13... Bb4 14. Nxd5 $1 Rxc1 15. Rxc1 $1 $18 {[%cal Rc1c8] Even better than Nxf6+. The threat of Rc8, which will pick off Black's rook, forces instant resignation.}) 14. Nxd5 $1 {A thematic tactical blow, dealing Black the ultimate punishment for failing to castle in timely fashion.} Rxc1 15. Nxf6+ {We must remain careful until the end: the sloppy 15.Rxc1 would drop a piece after ...Nxd5, when the check on c8 is parried by ...Bd8 (in contrast to 13...Bb4).} Nxf6 16. Rxc1 $18 {Black is a pawn down, and cannot cover both infiltration squares (c7 and c8) at the same time.}) (12... Rxc5) 13. Na4 {[%cal Rd3d4] Crushing. We exploit the undefended rook on c8 to the maximum, setting up the deadly threat of d3-d4. Black can move the rook to a defended square, but it will be immediately chased away by the bloodthirsty knight on f3.} Rc6 (13... Kd8 14. Ne5 {Hitting f7. Black is woefully overextended.} Rc7 15. Nxc5 Bxc5 16. d4 {This is a lot better than 16.Nxf7+, which only wins a pawn.} Bd6 17. Rxc7 Kxc7 18. Rc1+ Kb8 19. Nxf7 Bxf4 20. Nxh8 $18) 14. Nxc5 Bxc5 (14... Rxc5 15. b4 Rxc1 16.

Ne5 Rc8 16. d4 $18 {The rightful culmination of our lightning queenside attack. White wins the bishop.}) 11. dxc5 Nxc5 12. Qc2 {Cold-blooded and ridiculously powerful. As in the 10...Qb6 line, Black suffers primarily because the rook on c8 is not sufficiently defended, so the tension down the c-file is always going to favor White. We now combine the threat of b2-b4 with sharp positional play, maneuvering our knight to the optimal d4-square.} Be7 13. Ne2 {[%cal Rb2b4]} O-O 14. Ned4 {Not fearing ghosts on the c-file: there is absolutely no risk of a discovered attack, since any move by the Black knight can be shut down with Nc6, followed by Nxe7+ and Qxe7 (not to mention that our queen can also simply retreat).} Qb6 15. b4 Nxd3 16. Qxc8 Rxc8 17. Rxc8+ Bf8 18. Rb8 Qa7 19. Nc6 Qd7 20. Nfe5 Nxe5 21. Nxe5 Qd6 22. Ng6 $18) (8... cxd4 9. Nb5 $1 {Tabasco! This knight sally is particularly problematic in ...Nbd7 lines. With our king safely tucked away on the kingside, Black doesn't even have the option of hurrying the bishop around to c7.} Rc8 10. Nxa7 {Before invading down the c-file, it makes sense to snap off a pawn and return to b5.} Ra8 11. Nb5 Rc8 12. Rc1 $18 {[%cal Rb5c7] Now, we get down to business. The devastating threat of Nc7+ is unstoppable.}) 9. dxc5 Nxc5 (9... Bxc5 10. d4 Bb6 (10... Be7 11. Nb5 O-O 12. Bc7 Qc8 13. Rc1 a6 14. Nd6 Bxd6 15. Bxd6 $18) 11. Bd6 $14) 10. b4 Ncd7 (10... Na6 11.

Rc1 $14 {We saw a similar position to this one (with the pawns on d4 and b2) in the 9...Bxc5 10.d4 Bb6 line - this cosmetic difference does not change all that much. Black is still in big trouble due to the threat of Nd6 and the pressure down the c-file.}) (7... Be7 $2 {This leads to immediate material loss:} 8. Nb5 Rc8 (8... Bb4+ 9. Ke2 Ba5 10. Qc1 $1 {10.Rc1 is also good, but this is even better, since it essentially leads to a forced queen trade.} O-O 11. Bxc7 Bxc7 12. Qxc7 $18) 9. Nxa7 Ra8 10. Nb5 $18) (7... c6 8. O-O Be7 9. e4 {Classic stuff, controlling the center. Black has a very hard time finding useful moves, because we have complete control over the center as well as more active pieces.} O-O 10. h3 Qb6 11. Qd2 c5 12. e5 Ne8 13. Na4 Qd8 14.

Due to Black's lack of development, we are more than happy to give the c3-pawn away.} 6. Bd3 Ne4 {An inexperienced Jobava player would now be tempted to snap off the knight, but we are seldom willing to give up our light-squared bishop for the knight.} (6...

After recapturing the bishop, Qb3 will come with tempo, leading to a nasty queenside attack and a clear advantage.} 7. cxd3 O-O 8.

The knight on h5 is entirely out of commission, and Black has no good answer to the twin threats of Qxb7 and Qd1,which induces a near-fatal weakening of the dark squares around Black's king.} b6 14.

Bd3 Bxd3 8. cxd3 {As usual, we recapture with the pawn, leading to the classical central pawn formation. Our powerful knight on e5, coupled with our total control over key central squares, promises White a very pleasant game.} O-O 9. O-O a6 {Preventing Nb5.} (9... Qe7 10. Rc1 c6 11. Qb3 Rab8 12. h3 $14 {Now that our queen has left d1, it is important to take the sting out of the move ...Nh5, which can now be met by the prosaic Bh2. In fact, our next step is to drop the bishop down to h2 (or g3) on our volition, in order to reinforce the knight with f2-f4. The computer assigns White a very modest plus, but our experience leads us to believe that Black's cramped position and lack of a clear plan affords White excellent prospects in the middlegame.}) (9... c6 $4 {A thematic blunder, leaving the bishop on d6 undefended.} 10. Nxc6 $18) (9... c5 $2 {This is somewhat better than 9...c6, but succumbs to a similar tactic:} 10. Nc6 $3 {Amazingly, this lovely tactical shot is even more effective than 10.Nxf7.} bxc6 (10... Qc7 11. Ne7+ Kh8 12. Nb5 $18) 11. Bxd6 {Amazingly, this position has occurred once over the board - in a game played by none other than Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, in the year 2000! Black suffers decisive material losses.} cxd4 (11... Re8 12. dxc5 e5 13. b4 Re6 14. d4 $18) 12. Bxf8 dxc3 13. Ba3 $18 {Black does not even manage to gain a pawn for the exchange.}) 10. Rc1 {Bringing our rook into position.} Qe7 (10... b5 $2 11. Ne2 $16 {Black's last move was a terrible positional mistake, and we exploit it immediately by reinforcing our control over the newly-weakened c6-square. Before planting our knight on c6, it is worth piling up on the c-file with Qc2.}) 11. Na4 {A typical positional move, aiming to situate the knight on c5 when the moment is right. Notice, once again, the indispensable role played by White's central pawn mass: all of the crucial squares in the center, particularly e5 and e4, are under White's control. It is incredibly difficult for Black to find helpful improving moves.} h6 12. Rc2 {White's campaign is one of slow, but steady, queenside expansion. The queen will make way for the other rook, and once we are doubled on the c-file, the queenside pressure will reach a peak.} c6 13. a3 Rac8 14. b4 $14 {We continue to improve our position in countless ways. The knight will hop into c5, and Black will ultimately be forced into a nasty positional concession.}) 7. Bd3 Bxd3 8. cxd3 Nbd7 9. Rc1 O-O {In contrast to the position that arises after 6...Nbd7, the presence of the pawn on h6 affords us an exciting additional possibility.} 10. h4 {The experienced Jobava player will not bat an eye at this move, which sets up the potentially devastating advance of the g-pawn to g5. Black is best advised to immediately remove the knight from the pawn's line of fire.} Ne8 (10... Qe7 11. g4 {The threat of g4-g5 is instantly crushing, e.g.} c5 12. g5 Nh7 {Obviously, opening up the h-file with ...hxg5 merely hastens Black's defeat!} 13. gxh6 g6 14. Qg4 $40 {White has opened up a raging attack on Black's king. We threaten both the prosaic h4-h5 and the lovely Nxg6, and Black's impotent army is powerless to stop the avalanche.}) (10... Bxe5 {As usual, removing the knight from the board does not promise Black a single measure of solace. The knight will be capably replaced by an even nastier pawn.} 11. dxe5 Ne8 12. d4 $16 {Reinforcing our total central dominance. We will follow up by rushing the g-pawn up the board, posing decisive threats against Black's king.}) 11. Qb3 {Playing on both sides of the board! We deploy our queen to an optimal square and increase the queenside pressure.} Rb8 12. Ne2 {An important positional detail, buttressing the bishop on f4 and taking the venom out of ...f7-f6.} c6 13. a3 {Black's incredibly passive situation means that we are in absolutely no hurry to make any committal moves. Defending the b4-square is always a good idea.} f6 14. Ng6 Rf7 15. h5 $14 {We will follow up by gradually intensifying the kingside pressure with f3 and g4, while the king can be tucked away to safety on d2. White's robust central pawn phalanx means that our king will almost always remain completely safe in the center.} *
